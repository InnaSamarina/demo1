Ride the dragon toward the crimson eye
Flap the wings under Mars red sky
The reptile pushes itself out into space
Leaving behind the human race

Swim inside the solar seas
The Nebula cries out to me
Passing where I've gone before
I fly through the crimson door

Ride the dragon toward the crimson eye
